EXPLANATION & OTHER ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION

Parsing Log File:
The parse_log_file function reads the log file line by line, extracting timestamps and queries. It stores them in a defaultdict with timestamps as keys and sets of queries as values.

Counting Queries:
The count_queries function counts the unique queries based on the provided date prefix. It checks the format of the date prefix using regular expressions and iterates through the log data to find matching timestamps. It then updates a set with unique queries and returns the count.

Flask Endpoint:
The /1/queries/count/<date_prefix> endpoint is exposed to get the count of unique queries based on the provided date prefix. It calls the count_queries function and returns a JSON response containing the count.

Regular Expressions:
Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching in strings. They are used to validate and match date prefixes.

The other alternative method to load and read the large tsv file is by using a Pandas dataframe.

In the parse_log_file function, we can replace the manual file reading and parsing with Pandas DataFrame. Use pd.read_csv to read the TSV file into a DataFrame, specifying the separator as tab (sep='\t'). Specify the column names as 'timestamp' and 'query'. Then,Use groupby and apply to aggregate the queries for each timestamp into sets and convert the result into a dictionary.

Using Pandas DataFrame provides several advantages:
Pandas handles file reading and parsing more efficiently, especially for larger files.
DataFrame operations offer powerful data manipulation capabilities.
The code becomes more concise and readable.
